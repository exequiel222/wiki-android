## 2.2 Java style rules

### 2.2.1 Fields definition and naming

Fields should be defined at the __top of the file__ and they should follow the naming rules listed below.

* Private, non-static field names start with __m__.
* Private, static field names start with __s__.
* Other fields start with a lower case letter.
* Static final fields (constants) are ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.

Example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static final int SOME_CONSTANT = 42;
    public int publicField;
    private static MyClass sSingleton;
    int mPackagePrivate;
    private int mPrivate;
    protected int mProtected;
}
```

### 2.2.3 Treat acronyms as words

| Good           | Bad            |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| `XmlHttpRequest` | `XMLHTTPRequest` |
| `getCustomerId`  | `getCustomerID`  |
| `String url`     | `String URL`     |
| `long id`        | `long ID`        |

### 2.2.4 Use spaces for indentation

Use __4 space__ indents for blocks:

```java
if (x == 1) {
    x++;
}
```

Use __8 space__ indents for line wraps:

```java
Instrument i =
        someLongExpression(that, wouldNotFit, on, one, line);
```

### 2.2.5 Use standard brace style

Braces go on the same line as the code before them.

```java
class MyClass {
    int func() {
        if (something) {
            // ...
        } else if (somethingElse) {
            // ...
        } else {
            // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Braces around the statements are required unless the condition and the body fit on one line.

If the condition and the body fit on one line and that line is shorter than the max line length, then braces are not required, e.g.

```java
if (condition) body();
```

This is __bad__:

```java
if (condition)
    body();  // bad!
```

### 2.2.6 Annotations

#### 2.2.6.1 Annotations practices

According to the Android code style guide, the standard practices for some of the predefined annotations in Java are:

* `@Override`: The @Override annotation __must be used__ whenever a method overrides the declaration or implementation from a super-class. For example, if you use the @inheritdocs Javadoc tag, and derive from a class (not an interface), you must also annotate that the method @Overrides the parent class's method.

* `@SuppressWarnings`: The @SuppressWarnings annotation should only be used under circumstances where it is impossible to eliminate a warning. If a warning passes this "impossible to eliminate" test, the @SuppressWarnings annotation must be used, so as to ensure that all warnings reflect actual problems in the code.

More information about annotation guidelines can be found [here](http://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#use-standard-java-annotations).

#### 2.2.6.2 Annotations style

__Classes, Methods and Constructors__

When annotations are applied to a class, method, or constructor, they are listed after the documentation block and should appear as __one annotation per line__ .

```java
/* This is the documentation block about the class */
@AnnotationA
@AnnotationB
public class MyAnnotatedClass { }
```

__Fields__

Annotations applying to fields should be listed __on the same line__, unless the line reaches the maximum line length.

```java
@Nullable @Mock DataManager mDataManager;
```

### 2.2.7 Limit variable scope

_The scope of local variables should be kept to a minimum (Effective Java Item 29). By doing so, you increase the readability and maintainability of your code and reduce the likelihood of error. Each variable should be declared in the innermost block that encloses all uses of the variable._

_Local variables should be declared at the point they are first used. Nearly every local variable declaration should contain an initializer. If you don't yet have enough information to initialize a variable sensibly, you should postpone the declaration until you do._ - ([Android code style guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#limit-variable-scope))

### 2.2.8 Order import statements

If you are using an IDE such as Android Studio, you don't have to worry about this because your IDE is already obeying these rules. If not, have a look below.

The ordering of import statements is:

1. Android imports
2. Imports from third parties (com, junit, net, org)
3. java and javax
4. Same project imports

To exactly match the IDE settings, the imports should be:

* Alphabetically ordered within each grouping, with capital letters before lower case letters (e.g. Z before a).
* There should be a blank line between each major grouping (android, com, junit, net, org, java, javax).

More info [here](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html#limit-variable-scope)

### 2.2.9 Logging guidelines

Use the logging methods provided by the `Log` class to print out error messages or other information that may be useful for developers to identify issues:

* `Log.v(String tag, String msg)` (verbose)
* `Log.d(String tag, String msg)` (debug)
* `Log.i(String tag, String msg)` (information)
* `Log.w(String tag, String msg)` (warning)
* `Log.e(String tag, String msg)` (error)

As a general rule, we use the class name as tag and we define it as a `static final` field at the top of the file. For example:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private static final String TAG = MyClass.class.getSimpleName();

    public myMethod() {
        Log.e(TAG, "My error message");
    }
}
```

VERBOSE and DEBUG logs __must__ be disabled on release builds. It is also recommended to disable INFORMATION, WARNING and ERROR logs but you may want to keep them enabled if you think they may be useful to identify issues on release builds. If you decide to leave them enabled, you have to make sure that they are not leaking private information such as email addresses, user ids, etc.

To only show logs on debug builds:

```java
if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) Log.d(TAG, "The value of x is " + x);
```

### 2.2.10 Class member ordering

There is no single correct solution for this but using a __logical__ and __consistent__ order will improve code learnability and readability. It is recommendable to use the following order:

1. Constants
2. Fields
3. Constructors
4. Override methods and callbacks (public or private)
5. Public methods
6. Private methods
7. Inner classes or interfaces

Example:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

    private static final String TAG = MainActivity.class.getSimpleName();

    private String mTitle;
    private TextView mTextViewTitle;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        ...
    }

    public void setTitle(String title) {
    	mTitle = title;
    }

    private void setUpView() {
        ...
    }

    static class AnInnerClass {

    }

}
```

If your class is extending an __Android component__ such as an Activity or a Fragment, it is a good practice to order the override methods so that they __match the component's lifecycle__. For example, if you have an Activity that implements `onCreate()`, `onDestroy()`, `onPause()` and `onResume()`, then the correct order is:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {

	//Order matches Activity lifecycle
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {}

    @Override
    public void onResume() {}

    @Override
    public void onPause() {}

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {}

}
```

### 2.2.11 Parameter ordering in methods

When programming for Android, it is quite common to define methods that take a `Context`. If you are writing a method like this, then the __Context__ must be the __first__ parameter.

The opposite case are __callback__ interfaces that should always be the __last__ parameter.

Examples:

```java
// Context always goes first
public User loadUser(Context context, int userId);

// Callbacks always go last
public void loadUserAsync(Context context, int userId, UserCallback callback);
```

### 2.2.13 String constants, naming, and values

Many elements of the Android SDK such as `SharedPreferences`, `Bundle`, or `Intent` use a key-value pair approach so it's very likely that even for a small app you end up having to write a lot of String constants.

When using one of these components, you __must__ define the keys as a `static final` fields and they should be prefixed as indicated below.

| Element            | Field Name Prefix |
| -----------------  | ----------------- |
| SharedPreferences  | `PREF_`             |
| Bundle             | `BUNDLE_`           |
| Fragment Arguments | `ARGUMENT_`         |
| Intent Extra       | `EXTRA_`            |
| Intent Action      | `ACTION_`           |

Note that the arguments of a Fragment - `Fragment.getArguments()` - are also a Bundle. However, because this is a quite common use of Bundles, we define a different prefix for them.

Example:

```java
// Note the value of the field is the same as the name to avoid duplication issues
static final String PREF_EMAIL = "PREF_EMAIL";
static final String BUNDLE_AGE = "BUNDLE_AGE";
static final String ARGUMENT_USER_ID = "ARGUMENT_USER_ID";

// Intent-related items use full package name as value
static final String EXTRA_SURNAME = "com.myapp.extras.EXTRA_SURNAME";
static final String ACTION_OPEN_USER = "com.myapp.action.ACTION_OPEN_USER";
```

### 2.2.14 Arguments in Fragments and Activities

When data is passed into an `Activity` or `Fragment` via an `Intent` or a `Bundle`, the keys for the different values __must__ follow the rules described in the section above.

When an `Activity` or `Fragment` expects arguments, it should provide a `public static` method that facilitates the creation of the relevant `Intent` or `Fragment`.

In the case of Activities the method is usually called `getStartIntent()`:

```java
public static Intent getStartIntent(Context context, User user) {
	Intent intent = new Intent(context, ThisActivity.class);
	intent.putParcelableExtra(EXTRA_USER, user);
	return intent;
}
```

For Fragments it is named `newInstance()` and handles the creation of the Fragment with the right arguments:

```java
public static UserFragment newInstance(User user) {
	UserFragment fragment = new UserFragment();
	Bundle args = new Bundle();
	args.putParcelable(ARGUMENT_USER, user);
	fragment.setArguments(args)
	return fragment;
}
```

__Note 1__: These methods should go at the top of the class before `onCreate()`.

__Note 2__: If we provide the methods described above, the keys for extras and arguments should be `private` because there is not need for them to be exposed outside the class.

### 2.2.15 Line length limit

Code lines should not exceed __100 characters__. If the line is longer than this limit there are usually two options to reduce its length:

* Extract a local variable or method (preferable).
* Apply line-wrapping to divide a single line into multiple ones.

There are two __exceptions__ where it is possible to have lines longer than 100:

* Lines that are not possible to split, e.g. long URLs in comments.
* `package` and `import` statements.

#### 2.2.15.1 Line-wrapping strategies

There isn't an exact formula that explains how to line-wrap and quite often different solutions are valid. However there are a few rules that can be applied to common cases.

__Break at operators__

When the line is broken at an operator, the break comes __before__ the operator. For example:

```java
int longName = anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne
        + theFinalOne;
```

__Assignment Operator Exception__

An exception to the `break at operators` rule is the assignment operator `=`, where the line break should happen __after__ the operator.

```java
int longName =
        anotherVeryLongVariable + anEvenLongerOne - thisRidiculousLongOne + theFinalOne;
```

__Method chain case__

When multiple methods are chained in the same line - for example when using Builders - every call to a method should go in its own line, breaking the line before the `.`

```java
Picasso.with(context).load("http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg").into(imageView);
```

```java
Picasso.with(context)
        .load("http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg")
        .into(imageView);
```

__Long parameters case__

When a method has many parameters or its parameters are very long, we should break the line after every comma `,`

```java
loadPicture(context, "http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg", mImageViewProfilePicture, clickListener, "Title of the picture");
```

```java
loadPicture(context,
        "http://ribot.co.uk/images/sexyjoe.jpg",
        mImageViewProfilePicture,
        clickListener,
        "Title of the picture");
```

### 2.2.16 RxJava chains styling

Rx chains of operators require line-wrapping. Every operator must go in a new line and the line should be broken before the `.`

```java
public Observable<Location> syncLocations() {
    return mDatabaseHelper.getAllLocations()
            .concatMap(new Func1<Location, Observable<? extends Location>>() {
                @Override
                 public Observable<? extends Location> call(Location location) {
                     return mRetrofitService.getLocation(location.id);
                 }
            })
            .retry(new Func2<Integer, Throwable, Boolean>() {
                 @Override
                 public Boolean call(Integer numRetries, Throwable throwable) {
                     return throwable instanceof RetrofitError;
                 }
            });
}
```
